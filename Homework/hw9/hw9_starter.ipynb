The durations of blending paint batches 1 to 5 are 40, 35, 45, 32 and 50 minutes respectively.  The cleaning times depend of the colors and the paint types.  For example, a long cleaning period is required if an oil-based paint is produced after a water-based paint, or to produce white paint after a dark color.
